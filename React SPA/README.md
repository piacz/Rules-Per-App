# React App

This repository hosts a React project that defines a Single-Page Application (SPA). The access to some of its routes is protected using Auth0 User Authentication.

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the client project:

```bash
npm start
```

The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.
